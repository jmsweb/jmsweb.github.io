One of cool features about Jekyll and Liquid include customization of HTML error pages, i.e., 404, to its own file. If your project root, `/project-name`, has a file named `404.md` or `404.html`, it will be automatically shown as error page for when URL is not available.

In depth information about custom 404 can be found on [Jekyll RB - 404 page](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/custom-404-page/) as how to customize up to your own preference.
<br/>
### Example
<br/>
To get started with customizing your own 404 in either markdown or HTML format, simply place a `404.md` or `404.html` in your project root folder. If the 404 file do not have a front matter, it will be rendered as own layout independent of web template.

{% highlight html %}
---
layout: error
---
<div>
    How'd you get here?
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

The above example require a `error.html` file in `_layout` directory for Jekyll and Liquid to process any bad URLs.
