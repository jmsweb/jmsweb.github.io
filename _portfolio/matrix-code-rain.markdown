After few times watching the entire Matrix trilogy and one night I decided to code the mesmerizing code-rain. The implementation involve native JavaScript
with HTML5 Canvas and minimal usage of CSS. The entire coding took me about overnight, boy, I was exhausted and felt victorious after seeing the code rain
work in a web page.

This HTML5 Canvas is also responsive in either Desktop and Mobile view. You could even resize the web browser or view in your mobile device and the canvas
would fit nicely on screen!

Fork and clone my repository at [Matrix Rain Code](https://github.com/jmsweb/matrix-code-rain). If there are anything that could be improved, go and create
a pull request for review.
