<p>
    I'm a software engineer based in Detroit, MI specializing in building, testing, and engineering exceptional,
    high-quality enterprise and responsive websites and applications in both mobile and desktop environment.
    A mindset on single responsible principle and emphasis on quality of unit testing.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked on many applications that serve unique purpose in Java, PHP, and ColdFusion with different
    types of front-end flavors such as AngularJS, ReactJS, RequireJS, jQuery, and many more libraries and
    plugins.
</p>
<p>
    My experience include 10 years of developing web and database integration for internal- and external-facing web applications;
    a strong passion for clean code with sense of urgency,
    desire to automate every inches of the process,
    and engaged in learning new technologies and skills to meet aggressive goals.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, some of my works have implemented several web solutions that are still being used
    in multiple places including vehicle mobile scanner for car dealership, web and email content management
    system for organizations, and notification system for standalone applications.
</p>
<p>
    Other than technicalities and specifications, I enjoy cooking, golfing, laughing, and adventuring
    with my beautiful wife and two adorable children.
